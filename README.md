# openHAB-ansible

This is my ansible playbook to basically set up my home control computer.

Requirements
* ansible >2.0.0 (actual recommended)
* [ansible needs python](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) so it is also required

Run as root or sudo
```
sudo ansible-playbook openhab.yml
```
